        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: [Insert current date]</p>
        <p>At ReddiRecs: Product Finder, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>
        
        <h3>Information We Handle</h3>
        <p>Our extension is designed with privacy in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or store any personal information or search queries.</li>
            <li>Your ChatGPT API key, if provided, is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
        <p>The extension operates as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It communicates with Reddit's API to fetch public post data based on your searches.</li>
            <li>If you've provided a ChatGPT API key, it uses this to generate summaries. This process occurs locally on your device.</li>
            <li>We do not track, store, or analyze your usage of the extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <p>We do not collect or share any personal information. The extension only communicates with Reddit's public API and, if you choose, with OpenAI's API using your provided key.</p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of your data being compromised on our end. Your ChatGPT API key, if used, is stored securely on your local device.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>As we do not collect personal data, there is no personal information for us to provide access to, correct, or delete. You can remove the extension at any time to stop its functionality.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
